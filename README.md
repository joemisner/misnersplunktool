Misner Splunk Tool
==================

Misner Splunk Tool v2019.09.29
by Joe Misner  
http://tools.misner.net/

Misner Splunk Tool connects to a Splunk Enterprise or Universal
Forwarder instance via REST API, retrieving the instance's
configurations, input status, apps, and other useful information for
troubleshooting and analysis. This tool's intention is to grant easy
access into remote Splunk instances where shell or web access may not
be available, but the splunkd management port (default 8089) is
accessible.

Tooltips have been setup throughout the tool. For additional help,
hover your mouse pointer over different areas of the tool's interface
for more information.



Usage
-----

### Configuration ###

Configuration values for the Misner Splunk Tool are stored in the file
`misnersplunktool.conf` located in the installation directory of this
tool. This file is similar in formatting to Splunk configuration files,
and contains instructions on values that may be changed from defaults.
This includes listing multiple Splunkd instances and their credentials,
default REST API endpoints, and health check metrics that will show as
Caution or Warning in the Report tab.

If this file is missing on startup, a default file will be created. To
reset values back to defaults, choose the "File > Build
misnersplunktool.conf" menu option.

### Tools ###

The "Tools" menu contains the following options:

**Restart splunkd**

Instructs the Splunk daemon to restart. Similar to executing the Splunk
CLI `restart` command.

**Refresh Configurations**

Mimics the script executed when visiting the `/debug/refresh` URI on
this Splunk instance's web server. When used, this function will execute
all endpoints with `_reload` links, and return similar output to the
above URI.

Only works on Splunk Enterprise instances.

**Change Deployment Server**

This is useful for remote Universal Forwarder installations, allowing
you to enable the deployment client, change the deployment server URI,
and restart splunkd on the current instance.

### Discovery Report ###

This comprehensive tool connects to multiple Splunk instances, creating
a combined report of polled values across a deployment. The contents of
this report is identical to the Report tab of an individual instance,
multiplied by all Splunk instances listed. Usage of this report is
beneficial to document configurations, locate discrepancies, and
understand adjacencies, among other uses in the discovery process of a
Splunk environment. In addition to a saved report, the combined instance
adjacency data can generate a visual topology of the deployment.

**Execution**

To run this tool, a CSV file first needs to be completed. The format of
this file must be as per the following example:

    address,port,username,password
    1.2.3.4,8089,admin,changeme
    splunk.myhost.com,8089,admin,changeme

This example is included in the "discovery.csv" file located in the
Misner Splunk Tool installation directory. This file may be modified and
selected in the Discovery Report, or copied to another location where
multiple CSV files in this format can be kept for different Splunk
deployments.

After a properly formatted CSV file is chosen, each instance listed in
the file is loaded into the Discovery Report window. When the Start
button is clicked, a separate thread sequentially polls each Splunk
instance and gathers data. Once all instances are polled, you may click
Save Report to save this completed Discovery Report on disk. The
completed Discovery Report is also in CSV format, and can be loaded into
spreadsheet software for filtering.

**Topology**

In addition to the saved CSV report, clicking the Topology button will
generate a visual topology based on the polled data of each instance.
The Splunk instances are plotted in layers, by default in this order:

- Users
- Management Consoles
- SHC Deployers
- Search Heads
- Cluster Masters
- Indexers
- License Masters
- Heavy Forwarders
- Deployment Servers
- Universal Forwarders
- Non-Forwarder Inputs
- Other Instances

This primary role of a Splunk instance is a guess, based on the provided
roles which the instance is currently participating in, and may not be
accurate per the design of the deployment. Any new instances that were
discovered while polling the initial Splunk instances are also plotted,
and are given the label "Discovered Node" on the topology.

Instance node and adjacency colors among many other options are all
customizable in the Misner Splunk Tool configuration. These options
allow for tweaking to paint the topology to suit your needs.

After the topology is built, the window can be used to stretch, zoom,
and pan the image as needed. The topology can then be saved to disk by
clicking the floppy disk icon, and choosing a format such as PDF or PNG.

### Tabs ###

This tool is divided into multiple tabs, each with a corresponding
feature:

**General**

High-level overview of this Splunk instance, including process controls,
deployment information, and current messages.

**Report**

Gathers polled values into a report that contains discovery and health
information on a single table. Health values are determined by the
metrics listed in the configuration file, or defaults if not defined.
This table can be exported to CSV by going to the "File > Save Instance
Report" menu.

See the `misnersplunktool.conf` configuration to make changes to values
that flag a value into Caution or Warning status.

**Configuration**

Contains a dropdown for selecting a Splunk configuration file, polled
using the `/services/properties` REST API endpoint. This endpoint by
experience returns values that closely resembles the Splunk CLI `btool`.
Choosing a configuration in the dropdown immediately polls the instance
for the current running configurations, not just the startup
configurations listed in the .conf file on disk.

**Input Status**

Pulls data from the `/services/admin/inputstatus` REST API endpoint and
filters the results into sorted tables. Eases troubleshooting in
locating faults during onboarding and analysis of ingested data on
forwarders.

**Apps**

Lists the Apps installed on this instance. Useful in troubleshooting
whether an app has been deployed and enabled on a remote Splunk
instance.

**Indexer Cluster**

Data on this tab closely resembles the Indexer Clustering page under
the Splunk Web GUI's settings, returning health and status information
of the indexer cluster. Useful if the web interface and Management
Console are unavailable.

This tab is enabled on Cluster Master instances only.

**SH Cluster**

Data on this tab closely resembles the `show shcluster-status` command
on the Splunk CLI, returning health and status information of the search
head cluster. Useful if CLI access and the Management Console are
unavailable.

This tab is enabled on Search Head Cluster Member instances only.

**Resource Usage**

Returns resource usage of the Splunk instance's processes as well as
it's host system.

This tab returns data only on Splunk versions 6.3 and up, and not all
data is available depending on version and instance type.

**REST API**

Returns a simple interface for executing REST API methods against the
currently connected Splunk instance. GET, POST, and DELETE methods are
supported.

See the [REST API Reference Manual](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTREF/RESTprolog)
for more information.
